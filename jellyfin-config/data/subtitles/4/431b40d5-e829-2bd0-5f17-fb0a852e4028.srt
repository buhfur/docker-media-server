1
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,475
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,996
Oh, shit.

3
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:28,877
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,558
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,769
Where you coming from, Nick?

6
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:49,189
Fishing in Cuernavaca.
Mm-hm. Sure you were.

7
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,608
What do you say we take
a look at your catch, huh?

8
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,235
Come on.

9
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,202
Me, I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,710
So, Nick, what do you get?

11
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,753
Like a hundred bucks
a head here? Two hundred?

12
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,507
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer, my
friend, because you are gonna need it.

13
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,889
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,391
INS, Division 6.

15
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:27,060
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,729
Really?

17
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,566
Who you got your money on, Dee?
Tough call, Kay.

18
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,022
We've got a winner here, Dee.
Oh, I know.

19
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,988
Sir. Sir, you can't just...

20
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,615
Don't "sir" me, young man.

21
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:25,118
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

22
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,376
We're gonna have a little
chat with our friend here.

23
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,669
You fellas can hit the road.

24
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:38,632
Keep on protecting us
from the dangerous aliens.

25
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,638
You ever hear of Division 6?

26
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,891
There is no Division 6.
This is bullshit.

27
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,851
Hell, yeah.

28
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:54,064
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town, amigo.

29
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:57,025
In fact, I'm gonna bet dollars to pesos
you're not from anywhere near here.

30
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:02,572
Mikey?

31
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:12,290
Mikey, when did they
let you out of jail?

32
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,376
Political refugee, right.

33
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:17,671
You know how many
treaties you just violated?

34
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,006
One?
Try seven.

35
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,804
That's enough, Mikey.
You hand me that head.

36
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,853
Put up your arms
and all your flippers.

37
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,866
AW, shit.

38
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,579
Dee, shoot him.

39
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,044
Dee!

40
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,398
Th... Th...

41
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,193
Th... Th...

42
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,944
"That."
That...

43
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,155
Wa... Wa... Wa...

44
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,865
Was not human. I know.

45
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:30,076
Looks like you got some
entrails on you there, pal.

46
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,954
- What the hell?
- The situation's under control.

47
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,832
Calm down, please. Give me
your attention for a moment.

48
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,584
I'll be glad to tell you
what happened.

49
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:51,014
This is called a neuralyzer. It's a gift
from some friends from out of town.

50
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:54,643
This red eye here will isolate the
electronic impulses in your brains.

51
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,353
And more specifically,
the ones for memory.

52
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,147
That's good, fellas. Give me a
splay burn around the perimeter

53
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:02,526
with holes at 40, 60 and 80
meters from right here.

54
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,236
Thank you.

55
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:12,494
That's good. Thank you.
What in the hell is going on?

56
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,287
Excellent question.

57
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,123
And the answer you're
looking for lies right here.

58
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:23,046
- Who are you, really?
- Really?

59
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:27,467
I am just a figment
of your imagination.

60
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,182
Damn, what a gullible breed.

61
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,311
I'm serious, fellas. You're lucky to
be alive after a blast like that.

62
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:39,479
What blast?

63
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,189
The underground gas main,
genius.

64
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,650
You fellas need to exercise a lot more
caution before discharging your firearms,

65
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,987
I'll tell you that right now.
Especially you.

66
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,155
Have yourself checked out
with EMS

67
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,825
on the other side of the hill
before you leave.

68
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,213
I'm sorry about back there.

69
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,925
It happens.
Didn't used to.

70
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,179
The spirit's willing, Kay...

71
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,308
but the rest of me...

72
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,521
They're beautiful, aren't they?
What?

73
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,690
The stars.

74
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:29,112
We never just look any more No.

75
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,075
I'll tell you, Kay,

76
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,537
I will miss the chase.

77
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,211
No, Dee, you won't.

78
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:50,216
Freeze! N.Y.P.D. Freeze!

79
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,720
All yours, Edwards.

80
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,265
"Freeze" means stop.

81
00:09:58,433 --> 00:09:59,976
Yo! Whoa!

82
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:05,774
What the hell?

83
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,278
All right. Come on.

84
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,077
It just be raining black people
in New York.

85
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,603
Do you see this? Huh?

86
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,689
"N-Y-P-D."

87
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,483
Means I will knock
your punk ass down.

88
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,110
He's coming. He's coming.

89
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,654
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

90
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,494
Oh, you trying to catch
a beat-down, huh?

91
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,229
What's up?

92
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:10,982
He's coming.

93
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,027
He's coming because I failed,
and now he'll kill me too.

94
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:17,614
Yeah? Well, you're just
pissing everybody off today, huh?

95
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:22,869
You don't understand.
Your world's gonna end.

96
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:26,706
What the hell are you?

97
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,547
Hey, watch that ledge.
Watch the ledge.

98
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,216
Wait. Look, look,
come on down.

99
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,885
We'll get those eyes fixed.
Don't even worry about it.

100
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,429
Look, all right, wait a minute.
Let me talk to you. Hey! Hey!

101
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,730
I go out, I work
my butt off to make a living.

102
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:52,982
All I want is to come home
to a nice, clean house

103
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,777
with a nice, fat steak on the table,
but instead I get this.

104
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:56,986
It looks like poison.

105
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,614
Don't you take that away.
I'm eating that, damn it.

106
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,115
It is poison, isn't it?

107
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,743
I swear to God, I would
not be surprised if it was,

108
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,788
the way you skulk around here
like a dog who been hit too much

109
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,415
or ain't been hit enough,
I can't make up my mind.

110
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,292
You're useless, Beatrice.

111
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,839
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck.

112
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,642
Figures.

113
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:37,819
What the heck is it, Edgar?

114
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:42,782
Get your big butt
back in the house.

115
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:57,297
Place projectile
weapon on the ground.

116
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,173
You can have my gun

117
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,676
when you pry it from
my cold, dead fingers.

118
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,137
Your proposal is acceptable.

119
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,849
Edgar, what on Earth was that?
Sugan

120
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,393
I've never seen sugar do that.

121
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,730
Give me sugar.

122
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,694
In water.

123
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:09,702
More.

124
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,415
More.

125
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,723
Edgar, your skin
is hanging off your bones.

126
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,065
Oh, yeah.

127
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,486
There. Is that better?

128
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:15,601
"The perpetrator then blinked
two sets of eyelids."

129
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,311
You mean blinked
with both eyes?

130
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:20,898
No, sir, he blinked one set, then he
blinked a completely different set.

131
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:24,110
You know, like high
beams and low beams.

132
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,363
Was that before or after
he drew the weapon

133
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,783
that you claim evaporated
into a million pieces?

134
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,494
After, sir.

135
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,457
And why is it that none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?

136
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,334
Well, sir, some of the other officers are
a little soggy around the midsection.

137
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,295
I guess that's why
they weren't able to keep up.

138
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,338
Hey, Edwards, if you were
half the man I am...

139
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,133
What the hell are you talking about?
I am half the man that you are.

140
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,342
What is your problem?

141
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,470
My problem is you being
all up in my damn face.

142
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,139
I think he threw him off the roof.
Really? Maybe you next.

143
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,390
I wanna talk to you.

144
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:57,518
Ten minutes, you take
your best shot, tough guy.

145
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:02,065
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster,
you pudgy bastard.

146
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:07,987
I believe you.

147
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:09,947
Laurel Weaver,
deputy medical examiner.

148
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,241
Find me at the morgue
on 26th. I'll show you.

149
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,327
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

150
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,080
Excuse me,
you're Dr. Weaver

151
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,874
with the coroner's office
working on the John Doe, right?

152
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,585
Yes, that's right.
Will you look at this, please?

153
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,881
Phew.

154
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,177
Some night, huh?

155
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:34,806
Yeah, some night.
They were gills, not eyelids.

156
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,059
Gills.
He was out of breath.

157
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,687
Who are you?
Did he say anything to you?

158
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,690
Yeah, he said the world
was coming to an end.

159
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,692
Did he say when?

160
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,159
Would you recognize that weapon
of his if you saw it again?

161
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:56,702
Absolutely.

162
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,039
Come on, let's take a ride.

163
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:03,209
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, I got tons of paperwork and...

164
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,378
Right, it's all done.
Good work, Edwards.

165
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:08,506
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough, kid.

166
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:10,591
That's double tough.

167
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:24,730
So who exactly are you with?
FBI? NSA?

168
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,024
I'm part of a bureau
that licenses, monitors

169
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,652
and polices alien activity
on the planet Earth.

170
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,613
- Yeah, whatever.
- We're here.

171
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:36,868
This is where we going?
Yeah.

172
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,996
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.
He buys from chain-snatchers.

173
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,623
He doesn't even sell guns.
Really?

174
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,877
All right, look, I'm gonna slide up in
here and I'm gonna put my thing down,

175
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,296
but when I come back out,
I want some real answers.

176
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,548
Okay, go put your thing down.

177
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,598
Officer Eduardo.
Hey, how did these get here?

178
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,892
I thought I turned these in
to the proper authorities.

179
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,520
The way I hear it, Jeebsie, you into something
a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

180
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,732
Yeah, well, I'm a huge crack dealer now, but
I still work here because I love the hours.

181
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,068
I'm talking about guns,
smart-ass. Weird ones.

182
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,696
Come on, Edwards.
What you see is what I got.

183
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,868
Why don't you show him
the imports, Jeebs?

184
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,786
Hey, Kay. How are you?

185
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,121
Show him the imports right now.

186
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,165
I got out of that business
a long time ago.

187
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:25,791
Why do you lie to me?
I hate it.

188
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,460
Now, just hold on a second.

189
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,961
I'm gonna count to three.

190
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:30,296
- He'll do it, Jeebs.
- One.

191
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,215
That man does not look stable.
Two.

192
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,051
You know what? Talk to me.
He's crazy when he's like this.

193
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:37,136
He's always crazy. Why
don't you get a massage?

194
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:38,304
Take a cruise...

195
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,555
Three.
Drop the weapon.

196
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,390
Put your hands on your head.
I warned him.

197
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,100
Drop the weapon.
You warned him.

198
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,393
Don't make me kill you.

199
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,897
You insensitive prick.

200
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,486
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

201
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,239
Show us the merchandise or you're
gonna lose another head, Jeebs.

202
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,878
Mr. Edwards.

203
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:17,343
Right there,
the one in the middle.

204
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,766
You sold a reverberating
carbonizer with mutate capacity

205
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,727
to an unlicensed cephalopoid,
Jeebs, you piece of...

206
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,604
He looked all right to me.

207
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,106
Must have been
for an assassination.

208
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:31,732
Who's the target?
You know, I don't know.

209
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,901
Goddamn it, Jeebs.
I don't know.

210
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,572
That's confiscated, all of it, and I want
you on the next transport off this rock

211
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,033
or I'm gonna shoot you
where it don't grow back.

212
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:44,912
Yeah, and...

213
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,541
And I'm gonna be back
to talk about them Rolexes.

214
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,399
Searching for a handle
on the moment?

215
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,569
I can't help you.

216
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,405
The only comfort
I can offer is my promise

217
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:22,742
that tomorrow morning
you won't remember a thing.

218
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,578
Yeah, well, that's not exactly
some shit you just forget.

219
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:27,079
You ever seen one of these, son?

220
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:35,296
She looks over at her husband, then
she sets it back down in her lap

221
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,547
and she says,

222
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:40,301
"Honey, this one's
eating my popcorn."

223
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:46,098
Did you get it?
"This one's eating my..."

224
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,436
Whoa. I gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.

225
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:53,981
Hey, wait a minute. Who are you?
You see what I mean about tequila?

226
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:57,902
You're a very bright young man, James,
but you need to lay off the sauce.

227
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,529
Now, I'll see you
bright and early, 9:00.

228
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:04,283
Be there or be square.

229
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,639
Well, well, well.

230
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:30,142
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

231
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,311
I got a little eviction
notice for you boys.

232
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:35,398
Just what exactly do you
think you're doing here?

233
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:39,151
I'm taking care of your pest problem.
Pest problem?

234
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:43,447
Pest?
Yeah, you got a hell of an infestation.

235
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,534
You know, I've noticed
an infestation here.

236
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,248
Everywhere I look, in fact, nothing but
undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum

237
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:55,167
totally convinced
of their own superiority

238
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:59,505
as they scurry about their short,
pointless lives.

239
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,383
Well, yeah.

240
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,220
Don't you wanna get rid of them?
Oh, in the worst way.

241
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,718
Help you?
Yeah, this dude gave me this card...

242
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,761
Elevator.

243
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,914
You're late. Sit down.

244
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,088
My name is Zed.

245
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,925
You're all here because
you're the best of the best.

246
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,846
Marines, Air Force, Navy
SEALS, Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.

247
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,933
And we're looking for
one of you, just one.

248
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,769
What will follow
is a series of simple tests

249
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:41,273
for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

250
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,108
I see we have a question.

251
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,611
Yeah, I'm sorry, maybe you
already answered this,

252
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,364
but why exactly are we here?

253
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:51,408
Son?
Second Lieutenant Jake Jensen.

254
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,118
West Point
graduate with honors.

255
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:57,790
We're here because you're looking for
the best of the best of the best, sir.

256
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:06,799
What's so funny, Edwards?
Your boy Captain America over here.

257
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,219
"The best of the best
of the best, sir."

258
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,845
You know, "With honors."

259
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:15,975
You know, he's just really excited,
and he has no clue why we're here.

260
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,186
That's just...
That's very funny to me.

261
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,647
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

262
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,365
Okay, let's get going.

263
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,242
Wanna get down on this?

264
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,604
Edwards,
what the hell happened?

265
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:26,772
Hesitated.

266
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:33,237
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

267
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:36,198
Well, she was the only one that
actually seemed dangerous at the time, sir.

268
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,533
How'd you come
to that conclusion?

269
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,494
Well, first I was gonna pop this
guy hanging from the streetlight.

270
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,371
And then I realized, you know,
he's just working out.

271
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,375
How would I feel if somebody come running in the
gym, bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

272
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,128
Then I saw this
snarling beast guy.

273
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,715
I noticed he had a tissue in his hand,
and I realized he's not snarling,

274
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,007
he's sneezing.

275
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,802
You know, ain't no real threat there.
Then I saw little Tiffany.

276
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:00,139
I'm thinking, you know, 8-year-old
white girl, middle of the ghetto,

277
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,225
bunch of monsters, this time on
night, with quantum-physics books?

278
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,728
She about to start some shit, Zed.
She's about 8 years old.

279
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,105
Those books
are way too advanced for her.

280
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,649
If you ask me,
I say she's up to something.

281
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:14,945
And to be honest, I'd appreciate it
if you eased up off my back about it.

282
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:19,825
Or do I owe her an apology?

283
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,835
That was a good shot,
though, right?

284
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,508
He's got a real problem
with authority.

285
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,093
So do I.

286
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,430
But this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

287
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,849
That's gotta be tough enough.

288
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,019
Let's hope you know
what you're doing.

289
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:57,404
Gentlemen, congratulations.

290
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:01,116
You're everything we've come to expect
from years of government training.

291
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,995
And now, if you'll just follow me,
we have one more test to administer:

292
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,206
an eye exam.

293
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,553
Where are you going?

294
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:24,348
Yo. Hey, man,
what the hell is all this?

295
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,726
Back in the mid-1950s, the government
started a little underfunded agency

296
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:31,563
with the simple and laughable purpose of
establishing contact with a race not of this planet.

297
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,108
If you'll look directly at the end of
this device, we'll administer the eye test.

298
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,070
Everybody thought the agency
was a joke except the aliens

299
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:41,824
who made contact March 2,
1961, outside New York.

300
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,078
There were nine of us the first
seven agents, one astronomer

301
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,497
and one dumb kid who got
lost on the wrong back road.

302
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:51,458
Oh, you brought
that tall man some flowers.

303
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,086
This way.

304
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,713
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

305
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,843
Wanted to use the Earth as an apolitical
zone for creatures without a planet.

306
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,594
Did you ever see
the movie Casablanca?

307
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:03,971
It's the same thing,
except no Nazis.

308
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,597
Oh.
We agreed,

309
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,891
and we concealed all the
evidence of their landing.

310
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,477
Uh-huh. So these
are real flying saucers

311
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:12,646
and the World's Fair was just
a cover-up for their landing?

312
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,439
Why else would we
hold it in Queens?

313
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,693
More nonhumans arrive every year,
and they live among us in secret.

314
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,487
Look, I'm sorry, not to change
the subject or anything,

315
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,948
but when was the last time
you had a CAT scan?

316
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,783
Six months ago.
It's company policy.

317
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,952
Right, you should
make another appointment.

318
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,913
Look, tell your boy Zed I had
an absolutely wonderful time,

319
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,375
and thank you for everything, but
why don't you show me the door?

320
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,712
All right. I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some coffee?

321
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,798
No, thank you, I'm fine.
Okay.

322
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,137
How you doing, fellas?

323
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,556
Hi, Kay.
Hi, Kay.

324
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,183
That's not decaf, is it?
Viennese cinnamon.

325
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,103
Don't tell me we only got that
powdered stuff for cream again.

326
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,563
I hate that stuff.

327
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,401
Oh, that's good. Good, good.

328
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:00,652
You guys getting
along all right?

329
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,406
Well, don't work too hard.

330
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,325
Okay. Bye.

331
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,659
So you guys seen...?

332
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,120
Sure you don't
want some coffee?

333
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,170
All right, kid, here's the deal.

334
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:21,840
At any given time, there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet,

335
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,926
most of them right here
in Manhattan.

336
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,594
And most of them
are decent enough.

337
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,512
They're just trying
to make a living.

338
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,015
Cabdrivers.
No, not as many as you'd think.

339
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,017
Humans, for the most part,
don't have a clue.

340
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,144
They don't want one or need one either.
They're happy.

341
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,815
They think they have
a good bead on things.

342
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,025
But why the big secret?

343
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:42,945
People are smart. They can handle it.
A person is smart.

344
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:47,240
People are dumb, panicky, dangerous
animals, and you know it.

345
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:52,496
Fifteen hundred years ago, everybody knew
the Earth was the center of the universe.

346
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:56,041
Five hundred years ago, everybody
knew the Earth was flat.

347
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:00,837
And 15 minutes ago, you knew that
people were alone on this planet.

348
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:06,385
Imagine what
you'll know tomorrow.

349
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,555
What's the catch?
The catch?

350
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,600
The catch is, you will sever
every human contact.

351
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:17,396
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere.

352
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:19,898
Ever.

353
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:26,071
I'll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

354
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:32,119
Hey. Is it worth it?

355
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,413
Oh, yeah, it's worth it.

356
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:38,667
If you're strong enough.

357
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,853
What's up, pops?

358
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,656
All right,
I'm in because, look,

359
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,576
there's some next-level shit going
on around here, and I'm with that.

360
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:58,330
But before y'all get to beaming me up, there's
a couple things I want you to understand.

361
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:02,000
First off, you chose me,
so you recognize the skills.

362
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,796
And I don't want nobody calling me "son"
or "kid" or "sport" or nothing like that.

363
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,422
Cool?
Cool. Whatever you say, slick.

364
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:11,134
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

365
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,595
As of right now,

366
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,390
they mean precisely dick.

367
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,906
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.

368
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,659
Duration of stay?
Lunch.

369
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,036
Any fruits or vegetables?

370
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,671
<i>Please meet your
party outside the containment area.</i>

371
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,634
You wanna stay away
from that guy. He's, uh...

372
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,387
He's grouchy.

373
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:58,515
Three-hour delay in customs
after a trip of 17 trillion miles

374
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,559
is gonna make anybody cranky,
you know what I mean?

375
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,853
Hey, what branch of the
government do we report to?

376
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,564
None. They ask too many questions.
So who pays for all this?

377
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,983
We hold patents on a few
gadgets we confiscated.

378
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,445
Velcro,
microwave ovens, liposuction.

379
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:16,241
That's a fascinating little gadget.
It's gonna replace CDs soon.

380
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,743
I guess I'll have to buy
<i>The White Album</i> again.

381
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,912
Oh. That is a lot of fun.
It's a universal translator.

382
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,331
We're not even supposed
to have it. I'll tell you why.

383
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:24,749
Human thought is so primitive,

384
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,753
it's looked upon as an infectious
disease in some of the better galaxies.

385
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,755
That kind of makes you
proud, doesn't it? Huh?

386
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,090
Hey, what's this thing?

387
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,430
Okay, just be calm.
Just be... Relax.

388
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,807
Okay... Ooh, watch your head.

389
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,684
Somebody get him some ice.

390
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,646
Look out. Move... Just move
when it's coming at you.

391
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:55,947
Oh, damn. I will pay for that.

392
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,408
Oh!

393
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:11,129
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

394
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:15,467
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.
He thought it was funny as hell.

395
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:20,847
Sorry, y'all.
It was a accident. Sorry.

396
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,558
Observation, the heart
of our little endeavor.

397
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,019
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

398
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,439
This map shows the location of every
registered alien on Earth at any give time,

399
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,733
some of them under
constant surveillance.

400
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,152
Everyone on those
screens is an alien.

401
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,364
In public they're as normal
as you are, but in private, well...

402
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:38,990
You'll get the idea.

403
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,534
Oh, man.

404
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,662
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

405
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:47,832
Well, no, it makes
perfect sense.

406
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:50,418
When I was in third grade,
everybody told me I was crazy,

407
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,505
but I knew our teacher had to be from,
like, Venus or something like that.

408
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:58,426
Mrs. Edelson. It was Jupiter,
actually. Well, one of the moons.

409
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:04,224
<i>...revolve. Class, be quiet
and pay attention.</i>

410
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,103
<i>If I have to tell you
one more time...</i>

411
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,564
Edwards. Let's put it on.

412
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,316
Put what on?

413
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,403
The last suit you'll ever wear.

414
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,584
<i>You will dress only in
attire specially sanctioned</i>

415
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,795
<i>by MIB Special Services.</i>

416
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,132
<i>You'll conform
to the identity we give you,</i>

417
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,135
<i>eat where we tell you,
live where we tell you.</i>

418
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,556
<i>From now on, you'll have no
identifying marks of any kind.</i>

419
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,600
<i>You will not stand out
in any way.</i>

420
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:51,563
<i>Your entire image is crafted to leave no
lasting memory with anyone you encounter.</i>

421
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,897
Ow!

422
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:56,526
<i>You are a rumor,
recognizable only as déjá vu</i>

423
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,737
<i>and dismissed just as quickly.</i>

424
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,281
<i>You don't exist.
You were never even born.</i>

425
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:08,121
<i>Anonymity is your name,
silence, your native tongue.</i>

426
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,207
<i>You are no longer
part of the system.</i>

427
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:16,046
<i>You are above the system
over it, beyond it.</i>

428
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:19,215
<i>We're "them." We're "they."</i>

429
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:22,844
<i>We are the Men in Black.</i>

430
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:32,604
You know what the difference
is between you and me?

431
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:37,150
I make this look good.

432
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,154
We're gonna go
for a little ride.

433
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,947
I'll put you down here
for just a minute.

434
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:45,116
Then Daddy will be right back.

435
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:19,442
Okay, now we're ready
to go for a little ride.

436
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:23,196
We're gonna meet one of Daddy's
friends, and you're gonna like him.

437
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,618
Okay, let's see.

438
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:32,330
Bee, we've got the deposed
Sir Prefect of Singalee

439
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:35,417
touching down on the forest
outside Portland tonight.

440
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,336
<i>- Humanoid?</i>
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

441
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,090
Here. Red letter
from last night.

442
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,260
We had an unauthorized landing
somewhere in upstate New York.

443
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:47,554
Kay, keep your ears open
on this one.

444
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,141
We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger down here.

445
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,978
Well, well, well,
we got a skimmer.

446
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,064
Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?
Redgick.

447
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,359
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan,
but he's way out of town right now,

448
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:03,611
stuck on the
New Jersey Turnpike.

449
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,613
Why don't you take
junior here with you?

450
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,033
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

451
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,994
Go get him, tiger.

452
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,961
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger."

453
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,966
Zed. He just...

454
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,303
Unlimited technology
from the whole universe

455
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,390
and we cruise around
in a Ford POS.

456
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:36,019
Fasten your seat belt.

457
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,313
See, now, we got to work
on your people skills.

458
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,399
You know, you'd get a much better reaction
if you were a little more polite.

459
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,026
Fasten your seat belt, please.

460
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:46,237
Whoa, that was good.
Did you hurt yourself? Oh!

461
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,535
Oh, the red button there, kid.
Don't ever, ever touch the red button.

462
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,507
All right, bub,
that'll be $72, then.

463
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:09,260
Okay, sweetie, let me
pay the impolite driver.

464
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:13,950
Six is up.

465
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:15,868
Where is Ivan?

466
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,037
Gave him a break.

467
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:43,896
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the Galaxy.

468
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:47,609
You're right about one thing.

469
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,499
You're not going anywhere, pal.

470
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,129
What's going on?

471
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:12,884
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

472
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,226
I'd like to see your license
and registration, please.

473
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:29,525
Like to see your other license
and registration, please.

474
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:38,951
All right, your resident-alien card has you
restricted to the island of Manhattan.

475
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:42,288
Where are you going, Redgie?
Well, it's my wife. She's...

476
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,207
Well, look.

477
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:49,212
Oh. All right.
Okay, no big deal.

478
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:52,090
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

479
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,969
And you handle this.
What? Me?

480
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:58,930
Yeah, it's easy.
You just catch.

481
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:00,348
Are you sure he knows
what he's doing?

482
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,725
He does it all the time.
Let the man work.

483
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:06,187
Okay. Yeah.

484
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,320
Ooh! Kay. Oh... Damn, man. Kay?
Something's peeking.

485
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:16,447
Croagg the midwife
is at 54th and Madison.

486
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,574
You're headed out of town,
Redgie. What's going on?

487
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:21,244
Well, we're meeting someone.
Who you meeting?

488
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,662
Well, it's a ship.
A ship?

489
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,455
I didn't see a departure
clearance for today.

490
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:25,665
You didn't?
No.

491
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,459
- Well, it's... Well, it's an emergency.
- Kay! Kay!

492
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:31,129
You're doing fine, ace.
What kind of emergency?

493
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:34,340
What's the rush to get off
the planet all of a sudden?

494
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,509
We just don't like the
neighborhood any more.

495
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:39,637
Some of the new arrivals.
What new arrivals?

496
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:42,598
Does it have anything to do with
the crasher from last night?

497
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,016
Excuse me, miss.

498
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,482
Oh, man. Oh, man.

499
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:56,487
Kay, look. Oh, man.

500
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,658
Congratulations, Redge, it's a...

501
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:02,034
squid.

502
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,078
Kay, man.

503
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,584
You know, it's actually kind of...

504
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,550
...cute.

505
00:45:25,016 --> 00:45:27,185
Anything about that
seem unusual to you?

506
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,397
What would scare
Redgick so badly

507
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:34,400
that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?

508
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,778
We'll check the hot sheets.

509
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:43,326
These are the hot sheets?

510
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,536
Best investigative reporting
on the planet.

511
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:47,538
Go ahead, read The New
York <i>Times</i> if you want to.

512
00:45:47,705 --> 00:45:49,081
They get lucky sometimes.
Thanks, Manny.

513
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:53,503
Cannot believe you're looking for
tips in the supermarket tabloids.

514
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:56,422
Not "looking for."

515
00:45:57,965 --> 00:45:59,467
Found.

516
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:14,690
Wait a minute, slow down.
Why?

517
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:16,275
Give her time to get
the wrong impression.

518
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:18,319
Makes things go a lot smoother.

519
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,738
Can I help you gentlemen?

520
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:22,657
Yes, ma'am, I'm Special
Agent Manheim.

521
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:26,244
This is Special Agent Black of the FBI. We'd
like to talk to you about your visitor.

522
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,995
You here to make fun of me too?

523
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:30,832
No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have
a sense of humor we're aware of.

524
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:32,124
May we come in?

525
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,795
Sure.
Thank you.

526
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:38,548
Lemonade?
Oh, yes, please.

527
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:47,682
The chief of police himself came up to the house
and did a full-out professional investigation.

528
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,393
Took a police report
and writ down everything I said,

529
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,145
from A to Z,
not believing one thing I said.

530
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:55,898
Sort of poking fun at me.
And they asked me,

531
00:46:56,065 --> 00:46:59,986
"if he was murdered, how was he
able to walk back in the house?"

532
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:03,364
I gotta admit to you,
that one got me sort of stumped.

533
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:07,201
But I'll tell you something right now.
I know Edgar, and that wasn't Edgar.

534
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:12,415
It was like something
was wearing Edgar like a...

535
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:14,333
Like a suit...

536
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,253
an Edgar suit.

537
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:26,762
Dude was that ugly
before he was a alien.

538
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:32,852
I'm sorry.
Go on.

539
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:37,356
Anyway, I come to
and he's gone.

540
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:42,403
Did he say anything?
Yes. He asked me for some water.

541
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,907
Some, uh, sugar water.
Sugar water?

542
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:49,160
Yeah, I remember that right,
because I thought that that was odd

543
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:53,873
that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water

544
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,084
or regular water or tap water.

545
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,463
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

546
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,007
The flash of light you saw
in the sky was not a UFO.

547
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:06,010
Swamp gas from a weather balloon
was trapped in a thermal pocket

548
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:07,929
and refracted the light
from Venus.

549
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,305
Wait... Wait a minute.

550
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,892
You just flash that thing, it erases her
memory, and you just make up a new one?

551
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,685
A standard-issue
neuralyzer.

552
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:17,730
And that weak-ass story
is the best you can come up with?

553
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:18,940
All right.

554
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:22,443
On a more personal note, Beatrice,
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.

555
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,362
You're gonna go stay with
your mom a couple of nights,

556
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:26,530
you're gonna get over it,
and decide you're better off.

557
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:30,785
Well, yeah, you know, because
he never appreciated you anyway.

558
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:34,789
In fact, you know what?
You kicked him out.

559
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,541
And now that he's gone, you're gonna go
into town, you go to Bloomingdale's,

560
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,503
find yourself some nice dresses,
get yourself some shoes.

561
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,547
You know, find somewhere
that maybe you could get a facial.

562
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:48,386
And, oh, hire a decorator to come
in here quick because, damn.

563
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,352
Yo, Kay, look,
check it out, man.

564
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:59,939
When do I get my own flashy little
memory-messer-upper thingy?

565
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:03,401
When you grow up.
Mm. Okay.

566
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:06,237
Please, not green.

567
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:08,739
Oh, damn.

568
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:12,451
I don't suppose you know
what kind of alien life form

569
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:14,912
leaves a green spectral trail
and craves sugar water, do you?

570
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:18,499
Oh, wait, that was on
Final Jeopardy! Last night.

571
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:22,086
Damn, Alex said it was...
Zed, we have a bug.

572
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:25,423
So, what?
We don't like bugs?

573
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,050
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

574
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:32,513
They consume, infest, destroy, live off the
death and destruction of other species.

575
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,765
You were stung as a child,
weren't you?

576
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:39,103
No, listen, kid, imagine a giant
cockroach with unlimited strength,

577
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,857
a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper

578
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:46,444
is tear-assing around Manhattan
Island in a brand-new Edgar suit.

579
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:48,696
Does that sound like fun?

580
00:49:51,115 --> 00:49:52,199
What's the move?

581
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:55,703
With the bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

582
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:10,051
Where do you want
Contestant Number 3?

583
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:11,802
Just leave it there.

584
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:13,804
What's with the cat?
Oh, the cat.

585
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:16,265
Yeah, well, there's a problem
with the cat. Sign here.

586
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:20,436
What's the problem with the cat?
It's your problem. Heh-heh.

587
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:24,648
I hate the living.

588
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:27,943
Shall we?

589
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:59,725
Oh, my God.

590
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:05,523
Whoa, buddy, what are you?

591
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:16,700
Subject was approximately
112 degrees at time of autopsy,

592
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:19,078
indicating an increase
in body temperature.

593
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:21,122
Examiner tried to
verify this rectally

594
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,624
only to find the subject
was without a rectum,

595
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,543
which is, needless to say,
really...

596
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,169
Weird.

597
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:29,588
I'm Dr. Leo Manville,
Department of Public Health.

598
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:31,590
This is Dr. White.

599
00:51:32,383 --> 00:51:34,635
You boys must not
have much of a home life.

600
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:36,053
We watch the morgues
very carefully, ma'am.

601
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,347
Tell me, do you have something
unusual around here?

602
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:40,724
I'd say so. Triple homicide.
Mm-hm.

603
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:44,103
The first body I opened up was pretty
normal, except he was broken in half.

604
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,856
But when I opened up
the other two, well...

605
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:48,065
Let me show you.

606
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:58,033
There's a skeletal structure at work here
unlike anything I've ever seen before.

607
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,785
All right,
I'll have a look at this one.

608
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:02,371
Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver
check out the other body, please?

609
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:06,625
This way, doctor.
This one's even stranger.

610
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:08,335
I did a full laparotomy.

611
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:10,754
I started with the lesser curvature
of the stomach, but we could start

612
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:14,049
with the gastroesophageal junction,
whichever you prefer.

613
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:18,053
Let's start wherever
you started at.

614
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,930
Okey-dokey.

615
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,808
Oh.

616
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:29,815
- Is this your cat?
- Guess it is now.

617
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:32,443
It came in with the body.
Okay, dive right in.

618
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:33,777
I'm sure he won't mind.

619
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:40,159
Hm. You have really
pretty eyes.

620
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:41,827
Thank you.

621
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:48,292
Okay, you feel that? Where the
pyloric junction would be?

622
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:50,127
Push it aside.

623
00:52:50,294 --> 00:52:53,505
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs...

624
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:57,301
Nope, all fine.
Doctor, they're all missing.

625
00:52:58,135 --> 00:52:59,303
Of course.

626
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,223
Oh, you know, that's obviously
the first thing I noticed.

627
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:04,183
Well, what I was pointing out

628
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:10,147
is the fact that there are
no pieces of them left.

629
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:13,776
Yeah, you know,
so they're intact,

630
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:15,819
wherever they are,
whole somewhere.

631
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:18,489
That we can be sure of.
Have we met before?

632
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,492
I'm having the strangest
feeling of déjá vu.

633
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:25,371
Yeah, me too.
Really?

634
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:28,499
Okay, do you wanna know what I really think?
But don't tell that guy.

635
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,209
He looks like he's
under enough stress.

636
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:32,253
See, I don't think
this body's really a body.

637
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:35,714
I think it's some kind of transport
unit for something else altogether.

638
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:38,509
The question is, what?
Mm-hm.

639
00:53:38,676 --> 00:53:40,594
Is this freaking you out?

640
00:53:41,512 --> 00:53:44,431
No. Pssh! No, girl.

641
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:49,186
You know what I like to do
sometimes when it's really late?

642
00:53:51,397 --> 00:53:52,439
No.

643
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,025
Dr. White.

644
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,861
Um, excuse me.

645
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:04,827
What do you think?
Very interesting.

646
00:54:04,994 --> 00:54:07,454
She got a real queen-of-the-undead
thing going on...

647
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:09,873
Of the body.
Great body.

648
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,418
The dead body.

649
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,211
Man, you gonna have to
go look at that thing.

650
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:16,380
Dr. White?
You recognize him?

651
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:19,174
Yeah, he looks like the big guy
I saw down at headquarters,

652
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:20,551
- only a little deader.
- Dr. White.

653
00:54:20,718 --> 00:54:22,511
What do you think killed him?

654
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,139
A bug?
Dr. White.

655
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:27,558
You're up, slugger.
Oh.

656
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:32,062
Look at this.

657
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,065
What the hell is that?

658
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,753
Must...

659
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,839
To prevent...

660
00:55:01,133 --> 00:55:03,927
contest.

661
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:05,637
Okay, what are you trying to say?

662
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:07,139
To prevent...

663
00:55:07,306 --> 00:55:10,267
To prevent struggle?

664
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:13,771
No. To prevent...

665
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:15,189
War?

666
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:16,774
...war...

667
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,987
the Galaxy...

668
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:26,950
is on Orion's...

669
00:55:28,786 --> 00:55:31,955
be... Be...

670
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:36,210
- What is word?
- Bed?

671
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:40,214
Belt? Orion's belt?

672
00:55:58,816 --> 00:56:02,277
"To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

673
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:04,613
What the hell does that mean?

674
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:10,869
Doctor, uh...
Whatever, come here.

675
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,079
Dr. Whatever?

676
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:15,332
Hey, you guys aren't really from
the Department of Health, are you?

677
00:56:15,499 --> 00:56:17,334
Rosenberg. Aw, damn.

678
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:19,336
The Arquillians are
not gonna like this.

679
00:56:19,503 --> 00:56:21,880
This guy was one
of the royal family.

680
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,340
I knew it. This is an alien.

681
00:56:23,507 --> 00:56:26,885
And you guys are from some government
agency trying to keep it under wraps.

682
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:30,347
Look, he said, "To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

683
00:56:30,514 --> 00:56:32,850
This makes total sense. How
else do you explain New York?

684
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:36,186
The other day, I was in
this cab, and this guy was...

685
00:56:37,229 --> 00:56:39,440
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"
doesn't make any sense.

686
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:42,693
Look, that's what the little dude
inside the big dude's head said, right?

687
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,822
Right after... Damn, man.
You did the flashy thing already.

688
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:50,033
Hey, whoever you guys are, you're gonna have to
show me ID if you're gonna be in the morgue.

689
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,203
Oh, yes, of course, young lady.
Have a look at this for me, please.

690
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:55,038
Would you stop that?
What?

691
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:57,374
That thing is gonna give her
brain cancer or something.

692
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,377
Never hurt her before. Look, we
gotta get all the doors closed off.

693
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:02,379
Special Services
will be here any minute.

694
00:57:02,546 --> 00:57:05,048
"Never hurt her before"? How many times
have you flashy-thinged that woman?

695
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:06,216
A couple.

696
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:08,385
So, what, you not worried
about long-term damage?

697
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:09,720
A little.

698
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,722
Kay, have you flashy-thinged me?
No.

699
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:13,849
I ain't playing with you, Kay.
Have you ever flashy-thinged me?

700
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:15,184
No.

701
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:27,237
Look, Kay, I think I should be in charge
of the flashy-memory-thing department.

702
00:57:27,404 --> 00:57:28,697
Not while I'm around, ace.

703
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:31,408
You ain't gonna be happy till you
fricassee somebody's brain out, man.

704
00:57:31,575 --> 00:57:32,910
All right, we got
two dead aliens.

705
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:35,120
And a deputy medical examiner
needs a new memory.

706
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:36,747
Yes, sir.

707
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:41,251
Make it a happy memory.

708
00:58:01,772 --> 00:58:04,983
Oh... Oh...

709
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:15,994
Where is it?

710
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:33,595
<i>Will the owner
of a blue warp-speed cruiser</i>

711
00:58:33,762 --> 00:58:36,848
<i>please report to the front desk?</i>

712
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,415
Hey, Zed.

713
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:04,418
Doesn't anybody ever get
any sleep around here?

714
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:08,380
The twins keep us on Centaurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.

715
00:59:08,547 --> 00:59:10,549
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.

716
00:59:10,716 --> 00:59:14,511
Or you'll have a psychotic
episode. Here's Orion.

717
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:17,681
It's a grouping of the brightest
stars in the northern sky.

718
00:59:17,848 --> 00:59:20,517
And here's Orion's belt.
Right. That's what the little guy said:

719
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:24,187
"To prevent war, the Galaxy
is on Orion's belt."

720
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:26,732
Junior, there are no
galaxies on Orion's belt.

721
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:30,611
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.

722
00:59:31,028 --> 00:59:35,365
They're made up of billions
of stars. You heard wrong.

723
00:59:35,907 --> 00:59:38,619
Look, whatever, man.
I know what I heard.

724
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:16,740
Pretty lady.

725
01:00:20,744 --> 01:00:23,080
Uh-huh. Okay.

726
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:28,251
The grumpy guy's story is starting to
come into focus a little bit here.

727
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:31,046
So you were the guy in that picture
you showed me with the flowers.

728
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:32,422
Yeah.

729
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:36,551
And I take it she never
got those flowers.

730
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:38,720
So, what, she ever get
married or anything?

731
01:00:38,887 --> 01:00:40,305
No.

732
01:00:40,764 --> 01:00:42,057
Ah, well, you know
what they say:

733
01:00:42,224 --> 01:00:46,103
It's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all.

734
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:48,063
Try it.

735
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,731
Kay.

736
01:00:53,026 --> 01:00:55,862
Take a look at this.
My God, they're all leaving.

737
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:58,031
We've had 12 jump
in the last hour.

738
01:00:58,198 --> 01:01:00,158
Redgick was just the first.

739
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:02,786
What the hell do they
know that we don't?

740
01:01:02,953 --> 01:01:04,538
Why does a rat desert a ship?

741
01:01:04,705 --> 01:01:08,792
Give me Lem Sat 4, please, with
a proton induction thermoscan.

742
01:01:10,419 --> 01:01:13,213
Thank you.
Okay, Lem Sat 18.

743
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:16,007
All right, 4000.

744
01:01:20,387 --> 01:01:22,097
That's an Arquillian
battle cruiser.

745
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:24,182
And we've got
a dead Arquillian prince.

746
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,854
And speak of the devil.

747
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,690
They sound pissed.
Boys, translate that. Step on it.

748
01:01:31,898 --> 01:01:36,319
Why don't you get down to Rosenberg's
jewelry store and see what you can turn up?

749
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:40,031
Kay.

750
01:01:41,742 --> 01:01:43,827
Give the kid a weapon.

751
01:01:52,669 --> 01:01:55,964
Series 4 De-atomizer.
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

752
01:01:56,131 --> 01:01:58,049
Noisy Cricket.

753
01:01:59,885 --> 01:02:02,012
Hey, Kay, no, no.
Come on, man.

754
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:05,682
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer,
I get a little midget Cricket?

755
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:07,517
Whoa, kid!

756
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:12,689
Feel like I'm gonna
break this damn thing.

757
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,486
Hey, this is my truck.

758
01:02:59,653 --> 01:03:03,949
Yeah, and make sure you tell
them that down at the impound.

759
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:13,458
Please.

760
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:25,011
Who breaks into a jewelry store
and leaves all the jewels?

761
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:27,514
Somebody not
looking for jewelry.

762
01:03:29,516 --> 01:03:31,935
This guy had
a serious crush on his cat.

763
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:36,648
Kay, get down.

764
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:41,820
Man.

765
01:03:43,655 --> 01:03:47,200
That's him. That's the bug
in the Edgar suit.

766
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:11,641
We do not discharge our
weapons in view of the public.

767
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,977
Man, we ain't got time
for this cover-up bullshit.

768
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:16,605
I don't know if you've forgotten, but
there's a alien battle cruiser about to...

769
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,649
There's always an alien battle
cruiser or a death ray

770
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:22,944
or an intergalactic plague that's about to
wipe out life on this miserable little planet.

771
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:25,864
The only way these people
get on with their happy lives

772
01:04:26,031 --> 01:04:29,367
is they do not know about it.

773
01:04:33,538 --> 01:04:35,624
And don't worry about the bug.

774
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,710
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.

775
01:04:43,465 --> 01:04:45,800
Excuse me. Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

776
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:48,011
Zed, we need a containment crew
on Macdougal Street

777
01:04:48,178 --> 01:04:50,513
<i>south of Houston.</i>

778
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,766
Containment may be
a moot point, old friend.

779
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:54,225
The exodus continues.

780
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:58,521
It's like the party's over and the last
one to leave gets stuck with the check.

781
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:01,816
You sorry little ingrates.

782
01:05:09,032 --> 01:05:11,034
<i>What about the Arquillians?</i>

783
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:13,495
We've only translated
part of the message so far:

784
01:05:13,662 --> 01:05:14,704
"Deliver the Galaxy."

785
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:16,081
<i>They don't want much, do they?</i>

786
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:18,083
Oh, it gets better.

787
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:19,709
They're holding us responsible.

788
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:33,098
Where do you keep your dead?
I don't have any dead.

789
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:36,393
Where?
I don't know.

790
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,937
The city morgue?

791
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:51,241
That's three for a dollar, sir.

792
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:54,327
It was some light, some light
that refracted off of Venus

793
01:05:54,494 --> 01:05:57,956
into some swamp gas,
and that's what made the...

794
01:05:58,123 --> 01:06:01,626
All right, kid.
Excuse me. What's up?

795
01:06:01,793 --> 01:06:04,671
The Arquillians want the Galaxy,
whatever the hell that means.

796
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:06,339
We need help, a professional,

797
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:10,051
somebody with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

798
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:12,178
I just hope the little prick
hasn't skipped town.

799
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:15,265
Can I have
your attention, please? Thank you.

800
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:17,267
If you will gather over here...

801
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:20,937
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.

802
01:06:21,104 --> 01:06:23,440
If you'll look right here,
I'd appreciate it.

803
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:24,607
Thank you.

804
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,749
Now, that's the worst disguise ever.
That guy's definitely an alien.

805
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:43,460
You don't like it,
you can kiss my furry little butt.

806
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:46,588
You busy, Frank?
Sorry, Kay, can't talk right now.

807
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:47,839
My flight's leaving in... Whoa!

808
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:50,800
Get your paws off me.
Call the pound. We got a stray.

809
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:52,343
The dog owes my friend money.

810
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,304
Arquillians and bugs,
Frank, what do you know?

811
01:06:54,471 --> 01:06:57,140
I know nothing.
Not a thing, huh? Okay.

812
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:01,436
Stop, stop, stop it.
Okay, okay.

813
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:03,813
Rosenberg wasn't
some two-bit Arquillian.

814
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,815
He was the guardian
of a whole Galaxy.

815
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:07,275
They thought he'd be
safe here on Earth.

816
01:07:07,442 --> 01:07:08,735
And the bug had other plans.

817
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:11,988
The Galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

818
01:07:12,155 --> 01:07:15,658
If the bugs get their slimy claws
on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

819
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:16,868
Ask him about the belt.

820
01:07:17,035 --> 01:07:19,829
Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on Orion's belt.
What's he talking about, Frank?

821
01:07:19,996 --> 01:07:21,664
Beats me.
Beats you.

822
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:23,833
No, no, no, not around.

823
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,797
They're rehearsing
a ventriloquist act.

824
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:31,341
The Galaxy is here.

825
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:32,550
What do you mean, here?

826
01:07:32,717 --> 01:07:34,677
Galaxy's hundreds of millions
of stars and planets.

827
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:36,096
How's it here?
You humans.

828
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:38,515
When are you gonna learn
that size doesn't matter?

829
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:42,018
Just because something's important,
doesn't mean it's not very, very small.

830
01:07:42,185 --> 01:07:45,230
How small?
Tiny. The size of a marble or a jewel.

831
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:48,858
Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta
be walked before my flight.

832
01:07:49,025 --> 01:07:50,944
All right, get out of here.

833
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:55,865
If the Galaxy's here,
it's not on Orion's belt.

834
01:08:07,919 --> 01:08:09,462
Kay.

835
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:18,221
Boy, when you want attention...

836
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,517
Orion. That's a pretty name.

837
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:24,561
What's this?

838
01:08:35,071 --> 01:08:36,656
Wow.

839
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:20,783
Okay. Yes, good, thank you.

840
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:24,621
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

841
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:28,416
What's up, Farmer John?

842
01:09:30,126 --> 01:09:34,047
A man came in here earlier.
A dead man.

843
01:09:34,214 --> 01:09:36,216
And that means what to me?

844
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:41,721
It was a very dear
friend of mine.

845
01:09:41,888 --> 01:09:44,098
I believe he had
an animal with him.

846
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:46,643
It was a gift I gave him,
a pet cat.

847
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:50,730
It means worlds to me.
I'd like to have it back.

848
01:09:50,897 --> 01:09:54,400
Okay, I'm gonna need a picture ID,
written proof of ownership of the cat,

849
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:58,988
notarized proof of kinship
with the deceased.

850
01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:00,490
Don't do that.

851
01:10:02,283 --> 01:10:03,326
Do what?

852
01:10:04,494 --> 01:10:05,995
Don't do it.

853
01:10:08,623 --> 01:10:10,250
Oh, man.

854
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:27,350
Look, Kay, why don't you
let me handle this one?

855
01:10:27,517 --> 01:10:29,727
What?
All we gotta do is go in and get a cat.

856
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:32,313
It's not really that hard,
but if you go in there,

857
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,358
you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on her, start
flashing your brain ray all in her face.

858
01:10:35,525 --> 01:10:38,027
She gonna wind up with leukemia or some shit.
The woman's a doctor.

859
01:10:38,194 --> 01:10:40,863
She don't need you flashing away
half her med-school classes.

860
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,615
Five minutes.
Two minutes.

861
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,246
Where's the animal?
I told you, I don't know.

862
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:50,707
Well, let's see
if we can find it.

863
01:10:56,087 --> 01:10:57,213
Hello?

864
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:00,633
Hello?

865
01:11:06,556 --> 01:11:08,391
Hello?

866
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:13,730
How you doing?
Hello.

867
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:16,691
I'm Sergeant Friday
from the 26th Precinct.

868
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:19,610
A cat came in with
a corpse the other day.

869
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:21,571
"Orion" on the nametag?
Yes, that's right.

870
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:26,409
Right. Uh, well, this cat is a...
A witness in a murder case.

871
01:11:26,576 --> 01:11:28,494
I need to take him with me,
ask him a few questions.

872
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,246
Well, I don't know where
the cat is right now.

873
01:11:30,413 --> 01:11:31,789
Oh, you don't?

874
01:11:32,415 --> 01:11:35,084
No, but maybe you could
take me with you instead.

875
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:39,380
Damn, you do start fast,
don't you?

876
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:43,134
I'd really like
to go with you. Now.

877
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:46,763
Uh-huh.
And exactly why is that?

878
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,898
There's something
I need to show you.

879
01:11:57,065 --> 01:11:59,942
Slow down, girl, you ain't
gotta hit the gas like that.

880
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:03,613
No, you don't understand.
You really need to see this.

881
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,448
Oh, I Will, I Will.

882
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:09,035
I gotta drive.
You know, it's not some macho trip.

883
01:12:09,202 --> 01:12:11,704
I'm saying, that's just
the way I get down.

884
01:12:22,173 --> 01:12:24,133
Look, stud, you're really
not getting this.

885
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,429
There's something
I need you to help me with.

886
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:41,484
Freeze it, bug.
Christ, you are thick.

887
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:42,860
Look, how was I
supposed to know?

888
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,320
Do I have to sing it for you?

889
01:12:44,487 --> 01:12:46,072
If you weren't coming on like
some drunken prom date...

890
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,782
Oh, God. That is so typical.

891
01:12:47,949 --> 01:12:50,326
Any time a woman shows the slightest
hint of sexual independence...

892
01:12:50,493 --> 01:12:52,328
How about we shut up?
Let her go, shit-eater.

893
01:12:52,495 --> 01:12:55,039
Listen, monkey boy,
compared to you humans,

894
01:12:55,206 --> 01:12:57,750
I'm on the top rung
of the evolutionary ladder.

895
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,085
So can it, all right?

896
01:12:59,252 --> 01:13:02,004
You're breaking my heart. Show me your
face, and I'll cure all your ills.

897
01:13:02,171 --> 01:13:05,550
You ever pull wings off a fly?
You care to see the fly get even?

898
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:07,510
How far do you think you're
gonna get without your ship,

899
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:10,346
if that's what you call that piece of
space trash we got locked in the office?

900
01:13:10,513 --> 01:13:13,224
- Put your weapons down.
- Never gonna happen, insect.

901
01:13:13,391 --> 01:13:15,893
It's okay, Laurel.
How is it okay?

902
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:20,398
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

903
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:31,826
Let me go.

904
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:41,627
God, what the...?

905
01:13:42,587 --> 01:13:43,880
Come on.

906
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:50,219
Take me here.
No way.

907
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:53,139
Take me.

908
01:13:56,726 --> 01:13:58,394
Hey. Come back!

909
01:14:10,615 --> 01:14:12,158
He's in a cab.

910
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:36,682
Don't move, don't move.
Don't move.

911
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:39,936
Hey, man, what? Whoa, whoa.

912
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:52,990
He's not leaving the planet
in a cab. Let's go.

913
01:14:57,245 --> 01:14:59,956
Come with me. Put up a bio-net
all the way around Manhattan.

914
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:02,041
If it's not human, I don't
want it to leave this island.

915
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,501
Yes, sir.

916
01:15:04,043 --> 01:15:05,586
What do we hear from
our friends upstairs?

917
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:07,964
"Deliver the Galaxy."
The bug's got the Galaxy.

918
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,216
But we got his ship. He's gotta
be looking for a way out.

919
01:15:13,386 --> 01:15:16,681
<i>Plutonic fusion detection.</i>

920
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:19,809
<i>Plutonic fusion detection.</i>

921
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:25,606
What the hell are they
shooting at us for?

922
01:15:25,773 --> 01:15:26,983
Arquillian battle rules, kid.

923
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:29,110
First, we get an ultimatum,
then a warning shot,

924
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:31,445
and then we have a galactic
standard week to respond.

925
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:34,156
A galactic standard week?
How the hell long is that?

926
01:15:34,323 --> 01:15:35,783
One hour.

927
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:39,203
One hour? Then what?

928
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,042
Aw, that's bullshit.

929
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:47,336
Look, kid, to keep
the bugs from getting it,

930
01:15:47,503 --> 01:15:49,505
the Arquillians
will destroy that Galaxy.

931
01:15:49,672 --> 01:15:52,425
And whatever planet it's on.

932
01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:56,929
You're talking about us.
Heh-heh. Sucks, huh?

933
01:15:58,973 --> 01:16:01,684
I'm pulling up the location of every
interstellar vehicle within a hundred miles.

934
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:03,978
Already did it. Frank
the Pug took the last ship.

935
01:16:04,145 --> 01:16:06,188
We got Sneden's Landing
and Throg's Neck.

936
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:07,565
They're gone.
We have Atlantic City.

937
01:16:07,732 --> 01:16:08,774
Gone.

938
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:10,234
All right, Bayonne?
Gone.

939
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:12,570
All right, there's Three Mile Island.
Gone.

940
01:16:12,737 --> 01:16:13,946
- Yo.
- Staten Island.

941
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:15,197
Gone, thank God.

942
01:16:15,364 --> 01:16:16,991
- Fellas.
- We're running out of time.

943
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:19,368
If that bug gets off the planet with
that Galaxy, we're all bug food.

944
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:20,953
Hey, old guys.

945
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:28,210
Do those still work?

946
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:45,227
- You're coming with me.
- What?

947
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:48,731
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.

948
01:16:48,898 --> 01:16:52,943
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

949
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:55,571
Wait a minute,
you're taking the tunnel?

950
01:16:55,738 --> 01:16:58,741
You know a better way to Queens?
Man, that thing's gonna be packed.

951
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,131
You remember the little red button?
Yeah.

952
01:17:14,298 --> 01:17:15,758
Push the little red button.

953
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:18,427
And you might wanna
put on a seat belt.

954
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:21,681
Kay. Kay!

955
01:17:30,272 --> 01:17:32,400
You know, you're much too tense.
You're a young man.

956
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:35,111
You need to relax. Learn to
take some joy in your work.

957
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:36,529
Do you like music?

958
01:17:40,616 --> 01:17:42,660
That's better.

959
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:01,220
All right, now.

960
01:18:01,387 --> 01:18:02,888
Ah, shit.
Ah, man.

961
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:08,185
Kay. Kay!

962
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,025
You do know
Elvis is dead, right?

963
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:17,987
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

964
01:18:33,169 --> 01:18:36,213
You don't wanna eat me. I'm a very
important person on my planet.

965
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,673
Like a queen.

966
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,801
A goddess, even. There are
those who worship me.

967
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:42,845
I'm not telling you
to try to impress you.

968
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:45,181
I'm just letting you know
it could start a war.

969
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:47,892
Good, war. That means
more food for my family.

970
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:51,353
All 78 million of them. That's a lot
of mouths to feed, Your Highness.

971
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,190
You're a wonderful
dad, but I'm staying here.

972
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,506
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

973
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,759
Roaches check in.

974
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:24,386
They don't check out.

975
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:33,270
<i>Eight
minutes to the destruction of Earth.</i>

976
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:38,400
<i>Eight minutes to destruction.</i>

977
01:20:23,028 --> 01:20:25,948
All right, we'll use pulsar level five
with a subsonic implosion factor.

978
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:27,491
What?

979
01:20:27,658 --> 01:20:32,329
Just shoot the damn thing on the
count of three. One, two, three.

980
01:21:31,764 --> 01:21:35,225
Oh, you idiots!

981
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:38,354
You don't get it.
I've won.

982
01:21:39,188 --> 01:21:41,231
It's over.

983
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:45,778
You're milk-suckers.
You don't matter.

984
01:21:45,945 --> 01:21:48,447
In fact, in a few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

985
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:51,700
You're under arrest for violating
Section 4153 of the Tycho Treaty.

986
01:21:51,867 --> 01:21:54,411
So hand over whatever
galaxy you might be carrying,

987
01:21:54,578 --> 01:21:57,373
and step away from your busted-ass
vehicle, and put your hands on your head.

988
01:21:57,665 --> 01:22:01,043
Okay. Oh, I... I see.

989
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:06,215
I'll put my hands on...

990
01:22:06,715 --> 01:22:07,925
On my head.

991
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:13,389
Like this?

992
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:34,076
Kay...

993
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:44,628
That did not go at all
the way I planned.

994
01:22:44,795 --> 01:22:47,131
Whatever happens, don't let
him get on the second ship.

995
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:49,925
What? What are you talking about?
Keep him on this planet.

996
01:22:50,092 --> 01:22:52,094
Kay... Kay, where are you going?

997
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:54,847
I'm gonna get my gun back.

998
01:22:56,598 --> 01:22:59,059
Hey. Hey, bug. Wait a
minute, I'm talking to you.

999
01:22:59,226 --> 01:23:01,687
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a newspaper?

1000
01:23:01,854 --> 01:23:04,106
You're nothing but a smear
on the sports page to me,

1001
01:23:04,273 --> 01:23:07,276
you slimy, gut-sucking
intestinal parasite.

1002
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:10,779
Eat me. Eat me!

1003
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:17,327
Kay. Kay!

1004
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,795
Hey!

1005
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:30,466
What's up?

1006
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:33,844
You're just gonna eat and run, huh?
What about dessert? Ah!

1007
01:23:38,057 --> 01:23:39,558
Wha...?

1008
01:23:39,808 --> 01:23:41,435
That's it?

1009
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:45,647
Where are you going?
This party's just getting started.

1010
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:47,983
Where you going?

1011
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:50,819
Where you going? Ah!

1012
01:23:50,986 --> 01:23:52,154
Let me tell you something.

1013
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:56,366
There's only one way off of this
planet, baby, and that's through me.

1014
01:24:36,657 --> 01:24:38,200
Hey.

1015
01:24:39,368 --> 01:24:41,203
Where you going?

1016
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:45,791
Why you running, huh?
I'm still standing.

1017
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:47,960
Come on, bring it.
Come on, bring it.

1018
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:10,274
Uh-oh. I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1019
01:25:12,568 --> 01:25:15,529
Then that must mean that
that's your uncle, then, huh?

1020
01:25:17,364 --> 01:25:20,117
You know y'all look alike.

1021
01:25:27,082 --> 01:25:28,917
Well, well.

1022
01:25:29,084 --> 01:25:32,129
Big bad bug
got a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1023
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:38,343
See, what I can't understand

1024
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:41,430
is why you gotta come down here,
bringing all this ruckus,

1025
01:25:41,597 --> 01:25:44,016
snatching up galaxies
and everything.

1026
01:25:44,183 --> 01:25:47,436
My attitude is,
don't start nothing,

1027
01:25:47,603 --> 01:25:49,938
won't be nothing.

1028
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:58,113
You need to ease up out of my face
before something bad happen to you.

1029
01:26:00,407 --> 01:26:01,450
Too late.

1030
01:26:29,311 --> 01:26:33,607
Zed, call the Arquillians.
Tell them we have the Galaxy.

1031
01:26:33,774 --> 01:26:35,817
<i>You got it, friend.</i>

1032
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:41,657
Going to get your gun back, huh?
I like this gun.

1033
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:44,243
Yeah, well, while you was
in there playing around,

1034
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:46,203
I was down here
doing all the work.

1035
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:49,414
You know, first I had to bean him
in the head with this big rock.

1036
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:51,500
Then I was gonna hit him
with this 2-by-4.

1037
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:53,335
He kicked me,
and, you know, it hurt.

1038
01:26:53,502 --> 01:26:56,505
But then I got to the fire, you know.
I was like "ah" with the fire.

1039
01:26:56,672 --> 01:26:59,258
Not bad for your
second day of work, is it?

1040
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:03,178
Well, this definitely rates about
a 9.0 on my weird-shit-0-meter.

1041
01:27:03,595 --> 01:27:07,266
You should've been here for the
Zeronian migration in 1968.

1042
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:09,142
Whoa.

1043
01:27:09,977 --> 01:27:11,395
I guess you weren't
even alive in '68.

1044
01:27:18,235 --> 01:27:20,862
Interesting job you guys have.

1045
01:27:35,419 --> 01:27:39,006
Kay, um, look, I know we got
these rules and everything,

1046
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:41,591
but I was thinking,
she did help us bust that bug.

1047
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:44,761
Maybe we didn't
have to flashy-thing her.

1048
01:27:45,929 --> 01:27:47,681
Kay, come on, man.
What, who's she gonna tell?

1049
01:27:47,848 --> 01:27:49,266
She hang out
with all dead people.

1050
01:27:49,433 --> 01:27:52,728
It's not for her. It's for me.

1051
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:55,647
What?

1052
01:27:57,816 --> 01:27:59,943
They're beautiful, aren't they?

1053
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:02,195
Stars.

1054
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:06,199
I mean, I never look at them any more,
but they actually are quite, um...

1055
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:09,995
beautiful.

1056
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:16,585
Uh, Kay, you're frightening
your partner.

1057
01:28:16,752 --> 01:28:20,505
I haven't been training a partner.
I've been training a replacement.

1058
01:28:20,922 --> 01:28:25,344
Wait a minute, Kay.
I cannot do this job by myself.

1059
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:28,263
Hey, guys, my apartment
isn't anywhere near here.

1060
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,390
It's not even
on the same island.

1061
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:36,021
Days... months... years.

1062
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:38,315
Always face it forward.

1063
01:28:46,615 --> 01:28:47,657
Kay...

1064
01:28:47,824 --> 01:28:49,951
I've just been down the gullet
of an interstellar cockroach, kid.

1065
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:53,080
That's one of a hundred
memories that I don't want.

1066
01:29:09,846 --> 01:29:11,807
See you around, Jay.

1067
01:29:17,646 --> 01:29:21,316
No, you won't.

1068
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:55,892
Hey, Jay.

1069
01:29:56,685 --> 01:29:58,937
Zed called. The high
consulate from Solaxium 9

1070
01:29:59,104 --> 01:30:01,106
wants floor seats
for the Knicks-Bulls game.

1071
01:30:01,273 --> 01:30:05,360
All right, let's put in a call to Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.

1072
01:30:06,111 --> 01:30:09,531
Rodman? You're kidding.
Nope.

1073
01:30:09,698 --> 01:30:12,075
Not much of a disguise.
